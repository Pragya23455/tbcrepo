  <h1>William Shakespeare Biography</h1>
  <p>William Shakespeare (1590-1613) is one if not the most recognized poets of all time. 
    His ability to capture both the humanistic nature of man as well as cause the mind the ascend into 
    creative realms unknown has duly earned him the title of “The Bard”. Interestingly, when one associates 
    the works of Shakespeare to that of the literary world, generally the connection is made to his plays of 
    which there are 37. Comparatively, he has over 150 poems. It would therefore be a grave error for any literary
    scholar to overlook such works, especially those readers of the poetic arts.</p>
